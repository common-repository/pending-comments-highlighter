This plugin overrides the default pending comments background color in WordPress admin.

== Description ==

I have found a very annoying problem on the admin panel. 

Where the comments are listed, unapproved comments had lightyellow color (HEX:FFFFE0).
It is hard to make difference between unapproved and approved comments with this color.

This plugin changes the background-color to orange [#DD823B] (from WordPress 3.8 Sunrise admin color-scheme), and the author's name and his comment to white. This makes the comment approving system easier to see on all monitor types.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the extracted archive to wp-content/plugins/
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Enjoy!
